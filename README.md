# Image-Removal-Metadata
This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for removing metadata from image files. It uses the Tkinter library for creating the GUI, and the Pillow (PIL) library to open, process, and save images. The application allows users to select an input image, choose an output location, and remove metadata from the image.
